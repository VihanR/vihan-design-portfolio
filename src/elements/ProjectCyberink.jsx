The aim of this prototype was to determine the colours and theme of the application. A low- fidelity prototype allowed the team to easily communicate our ideas to potential end users without the extensive use of resources. The preliminary design concept of CyberInk is showcased above.</p>
                                        <p> <strong>Feedback:</strong> feedback in relation to CyberInk’s concept and design was gathered from its target users, university students. The general sentiment of users was positive, with many expressing that the simple card layout was intuitive and predictable. There were common suggestions by the majority of surveyees to enhance the user experience with a navigation bar that allowed the user to seamlessly move between the pages depicted in the home screen. Many students also expressed that the purple background of the application was too ‘flashy’. The team’s intention to create a techy theme unknowingly made it difficult for users to concentrate on the content of the application, which was an important consideration in future iterations.   </p>
